# Welcome to my profle

My name is ≈Åukasz I am a 29 years old happily married man, trying to improve my testing automation skills.


## At the moment I have four repositories that were created during my course, that taught me the basics of test automatization.
  ### They are mainly written in english, but there are some sings of polish language. I would say they are a bit outdated, but please take a look if you'd like to.

### Framework that i am acustomed to use is Selenium.

## I am currently working on a test that checks if I have applied for all junior position on No Fluff Jobs webiste.

This test is being run on Chrome ver.88.0.4324.182 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Revelead the test, It is not finished yet, but it should be up and runing soon.
